This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

x <- 10:1
y <- -4:5
z <- c("Hockey", "Football", "Baseball", "Curling", "Rugby", "Lacrosse", "Basketball", "Tennis", "Cricket", "Soccer")

theDF <- data.frame(x, y, z)
theDF
theDF <- data.frame(First = x, Second = y, Sports = z)
theDF

nrow(theDF)
ncol(theDF)
#if nrow() and ncol() both wanted at the same time, then
dim(theDF)

#Checking column names of a data.frame
names(theDF)
names(theDF) [3]

#Checking column names of a data.frame
rownames(theDF)
rownames(theDF) <- c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "ten")
rownames(theDF)
#set them back to generic index
rownames(theDF) <- NULL
rownames(theDF)

head(theDF)
head(theDF, n = 7)
tail(theDF)

#check the class of the data.frame
class(theDF)

#access individual column
theDF$Sports

#get the 3rd row from the 2nd column
theDF[3, 2]
#row 3, column 2 through 3
theDF[3, 2:3]




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
